By default sbt server talks via Unix sockets. `sssio` (*s*bt *s*server *s*tandard *i*nput and *o*utput) automatically discovers sbt server's Unix socket and converts it to standard input and output which most of the editors expect.

## Setup

If you are using neovim with [autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) then add the following to your `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:

```vim
let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
    \ 'scala': ['coursier', 'launch', 'lt.dvim.sssio:sssio_2.12:0.0.1'],
    \ }
```

This uses [coursier](https://github.com/coursier/coursier) to fetch the artifacts. If you are running Archlinux you can install [coursier](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/coursier/) from AUR.

## Config

To write all of the communication between sbt and LSP client to a file, add the following parameter:

```
-Dsssio.logfile=target/sssio.log
```
